 * JavaScript:
  * Logic, ES6+, React, Gatsby.js;

I try to communicate clearly, I can learn something new easily, I am flexible according to the demands that arise, I can solve problems and I am disciplined in the pursuit of my goals.

I try to maintain a balance between spiritual, mental, and physical health by dedicating myself to daily physical activities, playing my musical instruments, and taking time to read.
