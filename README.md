<h2 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hey!</h2>
<h3 align="center">I'm Itallo SÃ¡, someone who seeks constant self-development</h3>
<br>

I'm 25 years old, based in SÃ£o Paulo. I worked as a Front-End Developer in 2017 followed by 3 years on the entrepreneurship journey - an experience that taught me a lot - and now I'm back. I'm motivated by challenges and I've thirst for knowledge.
<br>

I found in the programming the synthesis of everything that keeps me motivated: constant challenges and an endless source of knowledge.
<br>

I'm a guy who loves **HTML, CSS, and JS**. And did some projects with React and Next.js.
<br>

ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying C to learn how languages work under the hood so I can learn to use high-level tools more easily.
