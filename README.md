---

<h4 align="left">About</h4>
I'm 25 years old, based in SÃ£o Paulo. I worked as a developer in 2017 followed by 3 years on the entrepreneurship journey - an experience that taught me a lot - and now I'm back. I'm motivated by challenges and I've thirst for knowledge.<br><br>

I found in the programming the synthesis of everything that keeps me motivated:
  * Constant challenges;
  * An endless source of knowledge.
<br>

<h4 align="left">Hard Skills</h4>
I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Logic, Code versioning (Git), Sass, BEM, Command-Line, Template Engine (Nunjucks), and I understand English with tranquility, whether listening or reading.
<br>

<h4 align="left">Soft Skills</h4>
I try to communicate clearly, I can learn something new easily, I am flexible according to the demands that arise, I can solve problems and I am disciplined in the pursuit of my goals.
<br>

<h4 align="left">Hobbies</h4>
I try to maintain a balance between spiritual, mental, and physical health by dedicating myself to daily physical activities, playing my musical instruments, and taking time to read.
