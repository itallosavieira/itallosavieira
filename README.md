<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Itallo SÃ¡</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Front-End developer in constant development</h3>

---

I'm 25 years old, based in SÃ£o Paulo. I worked as a developer in 2017 followed by 3 years on the entrepreneurship journey - an experience that taught me a lot - and now I'm back. I'm motivated by challenges and I've thirst for knowledge.<br><br>

I found in the programming the synthesis of everything that keeps me motivated:
  * Constant challenges;
  * An endless source of knowledge.
